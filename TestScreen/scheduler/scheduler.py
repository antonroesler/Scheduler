"""
All simulations run in here.
Important information: The time inside the Simulation is simply expressed by integer values. The Simulation starts at
time unit 0. If a process has a arrival time of 42, it will show up inside the Simulation as soon as passed time has
reached a value of 42. For the plotly gantt chart a time has to have a proper datetime. For that I chose to set the
start time as 2020-01-01 00:00:00 - it doesnt really matter. A simulation's time unit is transformed into 1 second
for the gantt chart.
